# SQL---Sales-Delivery

# Sales and Delivery Project

## Overview
## Overview
The "Sales and Delivery" project is designed to analyze sales data and customer delivery performance using advanced SQL queries. By integrating data from multiple tables, this project extracts valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency.

The database consists of several dimension tables—customer, product, order, and shipping details—alongside a fact table that captures transactional data. The project addresses key business questions, such as identifying top-performing customers, analyzing delivery times, and calculating total sales and profit per product.

Key SQL functions and techniques used include `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, and `COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS (CTE)`.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of how SQL can be used to derive actionable insights from sales and delivery data, aiding in decision-making processes for businesses.
